Add methods to analyze codebase context and generate sub-chores. Include validation for the four quality criteria (specificity, context constraint, containment, stability). Ensure ChoreDecomposer uses build_chore_planner_prompt from chore_prompts.py for consistent prompt generation following the established pattern.", "status": "work_review", "next_chore_id": null, "progress_info": "Implementation complete. Created chore_decomposer.py with ChoreDecomposer class. Implemented all planned methods: __init__, decompose_chore, _analyze_codebase_context, _generate_sub_chore_plan, _validate_quality_criteria, _create_sub_chores, and quality check methods (_check_specificity, _check_context_constraint, _check_containment, _check_stability). Class follows single responsibility principle and integrates with ChoreRepository. Ready for review.", "review_info": "Plan approved. Well-structured decomposer class with quality validation."}
